## Mathematical objects for dumps

* Set: a special kind of class, defined by some axiomatic system
* Class: objects that can be described using set theory language, but contradict axioms \(think Russell's paradox\). They are used to collect objects that are larger than sets.
* Collection: the notion of a bunch of mathematical objects collected together, which can be talked about despite its possible nonexistence
* Family: correspondence from one collection into another which uses one collection as indices for elements from another collection
* Sort: used to distinguish between objects. For example, geometry has the sorts line and point
* Type: not only are these used to distinguish between objects, but also talk about structures of objects
