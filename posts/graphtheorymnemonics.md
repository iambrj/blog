# Graph theory mnemonics

I always keep getting terms from graph theory mixed up. This live list contains mnemonics that help me remember them. They may be stupid or even "wrong" sometimes, but they help me remember the definitions nonetheless and thus are greatly useful to me.

* Walk : sequence of vertices and edges. Aimless **W**anderers **Walk**.
* Closed walk : walk that begins and ends at same the same vertex. The beginning and ending always **\*C**oncur\*.
* Circuit : closed walk with unique edges. Extra wires are useless.
* Cycle : closed walk with unique vertices \(except first/last\). Like a _**cycle tire**_, _**closed**_ and _**non-intersecting**_.
* Path : walk with unique vertices. _**Preposterous!**_ Every edge and vertex admitted _at most once_!
* Simple graph : no loops or multiple edges. _**Sanitize**_ dirty graphs
