As mentioned in one of my [other posts](https://www.notion.so/Common-argument-fallacies-42fcd8f69b474d81954df78f99ac0f3c), I've been reading Plato's The Republic and this post contains excerpts, thoughts etc

# Book 1

# Book 3

- Whither the argument may blow, thither we go

# Book 7

This is by far the most relatable part of the dialogue for me. Although I think the ideas on education were quite romanticized, I ended up liking them anyway because I believe the end justifies the means (at least in this context). Also, I felt this chapter was the most poetically written.
