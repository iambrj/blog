I have recently developed a habit of drinking tea and have tried various brews, including Assamese black tea, Assamese green tea, Darjeeling green tea, butter flavored black tea and chocolate flavored black tea. Naturally, I wanted to learn as much as I could about tea and this blog post series is an effort towards the same.

# Mythical Origins

## China

Emperor Shen Nong wanted everybody to boil water before drinking it and thus he himself was boiling it when leaves from a nearby tree fell into the pot. He was pleasantly surprised so much that he researched into boiling various leaves in water. He found the brew of a particular leaf medicinally useful.

## India

The Prince Bodhi-Dharma (literal translation: Bodhi - wisdom, Dharma - eternal & inherent nature of reality), a proponent of Buddhism, traveled to China from India to spread knowledge and to prove his principles, vowed to meditate for nine consecutive years without sleeping. However, he fell asleep at the end of nine years and ripped his eyelids in revolt and threw them away. The spot where they landed was where the first tea tree grew.

## Korea

The first tea plant was planted on a mountain near the borders of the city Changwon by the queen Heo Hwang-ok who is said to have traveled from a distant kingdom and brought the tea plant with her.

# Academic Origins

Most modern scholars believe drinking tea originated in Southwest China, where the ethnic groups used it for its medicinal value.

# Outspread

## Japan

Tea spread to Japan during the Tang dynasty when diplomats and monks from Japan visited China. There was a brief period of Sinophilia as well. Eventually cultivation began in Japan during the Emperor Saga with the Buddhist monks Kūkai and Saichō bringing the first tea seeds.

The Zen monk Eisai popularized tea in Japan. Eisai wrote the first Japanese treatise on Tea, Kissa Yōjōki (literal translation - Drink Tea and Prolong Life). Cultivating and consuming tea played a significant part in the lifestyle of a Buddhist monk. Kisai is also credited with introducing tea to the Samurai class when he used it to cure the shōgun Minamoto no Sanetomo's hangover from drinking too much saké. 

## India

Large scale tea production was introduced in Assam based on the tea plants cultivated by the Singphos tribe during the British colonial era in their attempt to attack the Chinese monopoly over tea production. The Englishman Robert Fortune is credited to have introduced Chinese tea in India by employing various means to steal tea seeds and saplings from the Chinese Empire, who regarded them as property. Most of these were planted in Darjeeling with the help of Chinese workers. Unfortunately, nearly all of these perished out and Chinese knowledge and technology that came later was key to sustain Darjeeling tea.

It is worth noting that being home grown and stronger, Indian tea proved to be wildly popular in the British Empire.

## Korea

Systematic plantation of tea in Korea has been credited to Buddhist monks traveled from China. Tea was a key part various ceremonies and of aristocracies. Tea was offered to deceased ancestors and to the Buddha. The reign of the Queen Seondeok of Silla saw the rise of tea imports from China, mainly in the form of jeoncha and dancha tea bricks from the Tang Empire. 

## United Kingdom

Tea, originally a drink consumed by the upper class, spread throughout the society during the 18th century in Continental Europe.
