# Musings : A Mathematician's Apology


Just the other day someone I know (and greatly respect to be sure) reduced mathematics to simply "solving exercises". This greatly saddened me since, on the contrary, mathematics is the exact opposite. In my humble opinion, mathematics is the expression of innate ideas in the most beautiful fashion, just like poetry, painting or music. A beautiful mathematical theory, conjecture or proof is bound to overwhelm the senses just as a bewitching poem or a melodious composition.

This essay characterizes the above sentiment and more. I think it must be read by non-math people, more so than their mathematical counterparts, since there is a lot more they can learn from it. The book itself has very little (ignorable imo) mathematics and is indeed written for the layperson. In this sense ignorance is wonderful, for an ignorant person can learn far more than a learned. The question "Would you rather choose all the knowledge in the world, or an eternal pursuit of it?" comes to mind.

Highly recommend reading, it is barely a hundred pages and can be read in an hour or two.

Would have been a 5 instead of a 4/5, but the mildly misogynistic undertones leave a bad taste in my mouth. But then again, the author lived in a different era and perhaps my standards do not apply.

So much for my thoughts. What follows are lines (some paraphrased)I liked form the essay

- There is no scorn more profound, or on the whole more justifiable, than that of the men who make for the men who explain. Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds.
- Need for justification has two components : whether the work is worth doing and why one does it
- Dominant incentives for research : intellectual curiosity, professional pride and ambition
- Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm from an anointed King
- The proofs are neither difficult nor interesting - merely a little tiresome.
- We do not choose our friends because they embody all the pleasant qualities of humanity, but because they are the people that they are.
- Reductio ad absurdum, which Euclid loved so much, is one of a mathematician's finest weapons. It is a far finer gambit than any chess play: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the game.
