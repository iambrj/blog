# One line explanations for algos/ds

This live list explains algorithms and data structures in way that is intuitive to *me*. If you also find any explanations intuitive, I'm glad it could be of help, but I maintain this primarily for *my* reference.

# Topological sorting

Keep deleting and appending vertices without incoming edges to a list.

# Strongly Connected Components

todo

# Dijkstra

Keep choosing the closest node until all nodes are chosen.

# Segment tree

Recursively break arrays in half, track sum of each piece.

# MST

## Prim

Prim is proper, pristine, palpable, pragmatic: it starts with nothing and adds one vertex at a time.

## Kruskal

Kruskal is crude, clunky, knobby: it starts with multiple vertices and adds on edge at a time.
